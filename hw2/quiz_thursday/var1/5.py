"""
This cipher replaces every letter with a different letter. 
For instance every a might be replaced with an e, every b might be replaced with an a, etc. 
Write a program that asks the user to enter two strings. 
Then determine if the second string could be an encoded version of the Ô¨Årst one with a substitution cipher. 
For instance, CXYZ is not an encoded version of BOOK because O got mapped to two separate letters. 
Also, CXXK is not an encoded version of BOOK, because K got mapped to itself. On the other hand, CXXZ would be an encoding of BOOK. 
This problem can be done with or without a dictionary.
